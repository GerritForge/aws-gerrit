Licensed Work: Gerrit Enterprise, aws-gerrit
Licensor: GerritForge, Inc.
License: Business Source License 1.1 ("BSL")
Change Date: The earlier of (a) four (5) years from the date the Licensed Work version is first made
generally available by the Licensor, or (b) a date separately designated in the source code
repository for that version.
Change License: Apache 2.0

1. Grant

Subject to the conditions below, the Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable,
royalty-free license to: (i) copy, modify, create derivative works of, and redistribute the Licensed
Work; and (ii) make non-production use of the Licensed Work.

The Licensor may offer an Additional Use Grant (Section 2) that permits certain production uses.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Licensor.

2. Additional Use Grant (Production Use)

You may run the Licensed Work in production for your own or your organization's internal business
purposes, provided that your use does not: (1) offer, provide, or enable a hosted, managed, or
embedded service whose core purpose is to provide functionality that is a substitute for, or
materially equivalent to, Gerrit Enterprise or any paid, commercial, or enterprise offering of the
Licensor that includes Gerrit Enterprise; or (2) constitute providing the Licensed Work (or
substantial portions thereof) to third parties as a service or product that competes with any
commercial offering from the Licensor in code review, code collaboration, or CI/CD orchestration
based on Gerrit.

Partners, integrations, extensions, and plugins that do not provide a competing hosted or embedded
substitute are permitted, including building and distributing integrations, connectors, or plugins,
and operating the Licensed Work to support your own internal development workflows.

For any production use outside this Additional Use Grant, you must obtain a separate commercial
license from the Licensor.

3. Change Date and Change License

On the Change Date, the license for the then-current version of the Licensed Work automatically and
permanently transitions to the Change License specified above. After the Change Date, your rights to
that version are governed by the Change License, in addition to any rights obtained under this BSL
prior to the Change Date.

4. Scope, Copies, and Notices

You must include a copy of this License (or a URL/reference to it) with all copies of the Licensed
Work you distribute. You must retain all copyright, license, and attribution notices in source files
and documentation. If you modify the Licensed Work and distribute your modifications, you must
describe material changes in a prominent notice.

5. Trademarks

This License does not grant rights to use the Licensor's names, logos, or trademarks. Any permitted
use of trademarks must follow the Licensor's applicable trademark guidelines or a separate written
permission.

6. No Warranty

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING
THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING OR REDISTRIBUTING THE LICENSED WORK AND ASSUME ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED
WITH YOUR EXERCISE OF PERMISSIONS UNDER THIS LICENSE.

7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED WORK OR THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

8. Termination

Your rights under this License terminate automatically if you materially breach it and fail to cure
within 30 days of notice. Upon termination, you must cease use of the Licensed Work in production
and stop distributing copies; reasonable non-production use may continue solely for internal
evaluation and migration. Sections 5–9 survive termination.

9. Relationship to Other Agreements

If you have a separate written agreement with the Licensor covering use of the Licensed Work, that
agreement governs to the extent of any direct conflict with this License. Nothing in this License is
intended to reduce, limit, or restrict rights granted under the Change License after the Change
Date.
